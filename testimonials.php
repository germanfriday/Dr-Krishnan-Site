                  <ul>
                    <li>Dr. Krishnan has given me the very best care for more than 25 years. She&rsquo;s never in a hurry during the office visit, is warm and considerate and knowledgeable in many areas.<br />

                        <br />
                      </span></li>
                    <li> She&rsquo;s very understanding and is a good listener. She takes time for me. I&rsquo;ve been seeing Dr. Krishnan for more than seven years and am in good health. When I was in the hospital, she came to see me twice a day.<br />

                          <br />
                      </li>
                    <li>I&rsquo;ve received excellent care from Dr. Krishnan. She&rsquo;s understanding, reassuring, knowledgeable and has a good bedside manner. She adjusted my medication, which lowered my blood pressure and regulated my heart rhythm. She also solved my stomach problem. She made me feel healthy and gave me peace of mind.<br />
