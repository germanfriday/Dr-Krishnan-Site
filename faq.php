                    <span class="PageTextBold">A.</span> When you are overweight, there&rsquo;s added stress placed on your heart and other major organs. Obesity can cause a condition known as fatty liver and put you at risk for cirrhosis of the liver. This serious disease slows the processing of wastes and other toxins from your body. When you&rsquo;re overweight, your blood pressure often rises to pump more blood to your heart. Your knees take the brunt of excess weight and can begin to cause pain. Plus, you&rsquo;re at a higher risk for diabetes. Maintaining an ideal weight helps keep major organs functioning properly.</td>

                    <br/>
                    <span class="PageTextBold">A.</span> Anemia has many different causes. The first step is to get a proper diagnosis of what is causing your anemia, which is often the underlying condition rather than the primary condition. It may be associated with an iron deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome (a form of cancer), internal bleeding or another blood-related condition. A thorough examination and treatment plan will go a long way toward keeping your good health.</td>

                    <br />
                    <span class="PageTextBold">A.</span> Maintain regular visits to your doctor, perform monthly breast self examinations, and continue to get mammograms every year or as recommended by your physician. Blood work and other lab tests will be performed at your office visit to monitor changes in your overall health. Carefully monitor your own health for changes in your appetite or energy levels, and schedule an appointment whenever you have health concerns. There&rsquo;s no guarantee that breast cancer won&rsquo;t recur, but there is a greater chance of cure thanks to early detection and advanced treatment.                    </td>

                    <br />
                    <span class="PageTextBold">A.</span> You can ask your aunt if her physician has used the most advanced treatment available. Did the physician work with a team of cancer specialists &ndash; an oncologist and a radiation oncologist&nbsp;&ndash; to formulate and administer a treatment plan? If not, there may still be time to take this route. However, if the cancer truly is incurable, the physician&rsquo;s efforts turn toward pain management and relieving symptoms. Family support is very important at this time.</td>

                    <br />
                    <span class="PageTextBold">A.</span> This is a common dilemma. If you are middle-aged or younger and otherwise in good health, you probably should schedule a same-day appointment with your physician. If you are a senior, go to the emergency room. Patients are welcome to call our office to ask for guidance in which health care setting is best. If you do decide on the emergency room, ask the attending physician to send a report to your primary care physician.</td>

				  <br />
                  <span class="PageTextBold">A.</span> Having an empathetic physician who can address your full range of complications is important. This is a role that I gladly serve for my patients. Counseling is a big part of my office visits with seniors. Patients want to know about their condition in terms they can understand. My aim is to control symptoms, help patients cope with their illness, and seek to improve my patients&rsquo; quality of life. I also invite adult children to attend office visits with parents. It often helps to have two people listen to what the doctor says.</td>

                  <td align="left" class="PageText"><span class="PageTextBold">Q. I&rsquo;m 50 pounds overweight and have tried many diets, but nothing has worked. How can your diet plan help me lose weight and keep it off?</span><br />
                    <br />
                      <span class="PageTextBold">A.</span> Losing weight is a challenge. Our office has a weight loss program that focuses on a low-calorie diet that includes a nutritional shake (W.H.I.C.). The shake, which comes in chocolate or vanilla, contains all the daily required nutrients with 160 calories for 10 to 11 ounces. People can drink this shake up to four times a day as a meal supplement with a meal plan (provided by our office). Drink the shake with a lower calorie diet until you reach your desired weight, then use the shake as a supplement only. 
                  <br /><br />
                  Low-calorie diets range from 1,000 to 1,200 calories, but should only be attempted under a doctor&rsquo;s supervision. Typically, people eat about 2,000 to 3,000 calories a day. The shake can help you lose 10 pounds or 100 pounds or more. However, you must adhere to good eating habits (fruits and vegetables, whole grains and low-fat food) while getting regular exercise of 20 minutes a day. Keeping a food and exercise journal can help track your progress. Once you lose weight, eating a low-calorie diet and exercising are the best ways to keep it off. The most effective weight loss takes willpower and effort, but the results are amazing.</td>

I monitor the patient&rsquo;s care, review reports from other physicians involved in my patient&rsquo;s care, and modify the treatment plan as needed. Following hospital discharge, I can perform outpatient chemotherapy in my office and continue to monitor my patient&rsquo;s health with regular examinations and testing. It&rsquo;s a comprehensive plan that encompasses expertise, coordinated care, empathy and good communication.</td>

High blood cholesterol levels can often be managed by diet; if not, medication will be prescribed and often is an important prevention tool. Stress management techniques, such as meditation and relaxation, should be done on a daily basis. These are all elements of my care management plan to screen for heart disease and provide preventive treatment.</td>
