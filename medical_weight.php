      <p>With obesity soaring in the United States, and especially in Michigan, prevention is critical to ensuring an acceptable weight level throughout one&#39;s adult life. When a person is obese (30 percent over ideal body weight), they store excess fat tissue under the skin and around joints and organs &ndash; putting added pressure on overall function. Excess weight makes it hard to walk and saps energy levels. Even more threatening, people who are vastly overweight or obese have a greater risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, stroke and heart disease. </p>
      <p>Dr. Krishnan uses a two-fold approach to weight loss, termed the W.H.I.C. weight loss program. The first aspect focuses on an educational session to discuss lifestyle choices that impact weight, along with weigh-ins. This monitors weight loss and provides encouragement as well as a valuable support system. In addition, patients receive a special dietary supplement (a nutritious shake that provides all the daily requirements for vitamins and minerals) with a low-fat diet plan and recommended exercise. In combination, these segments help people to stay healthy.</p></td>
